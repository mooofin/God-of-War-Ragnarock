Ready to unlock God of War: Ragnarok's full potential? This guide shows you how to wield the power of Cheat Engine and bypass those pesky VRAM limits. Whether you're looking for infinite hacks or smoother gameplay, we’ve got you covered! 💪⚡

What You'll Need
Before we start flexing those Odin-like powers, make sure you’ve got:

Cheat Engine 🛠️

Download from Cheat Engine. It’s your magic hammer for hacking memory.
Cheat Table 📜

Grab the cheat table from this repo (or a reliable source).
Admin Mode Activated 🔐

Run Cheat Engine and the game as Administrator because gods need authority too.
Game in Windowed/Borderless Mode 🖥️

Makes it easier to see what you’re messing with.
Unleashing the Cheat Table
It’s time to unlock god mode! Follow these steps to rule Midgard:

Boot Up the Game 🚀

Fire up God of War: Ragnarok and load your save.
Summon Cheat Engine 🧙‍♂️

Open Cheat Engine and click the glowing computer icon (Process List).
Find GOWR.exe and hit Open.
Load the Cheat Table 📂

In Cheat Engine, go to File > Load and choose your .CT file.
Activate Your Powers 🔥

Look for fun hacks like Infinite Health, Unlimited Rage, or Max Resources.
Click the checkboxes to unleash them.
The Mighty VRAM Bypass
Is your GPU crying under the weight of the Nine Realms? Let’s silence the whining with the VRAM bypass:

Locate the VRAM Bypass Script 🛡️

In the cheat table, find the VRAM Bypass option (look for something epic-sounding).
Flip the Switch ⚡

Check the box, and just like that, your game no longer cares about VRAM limits. Who needs restrictions anyway?
Test Your Divine Intervention ✅

Restart the game if needed and watch it run like a dream. You’re now free to conquer in style.
Troubleshooting the Trickery
Cheat Engine Can’t Attach:
Double-check you’re in admin mode. The gods frown upon weak privileges.

Game Crashes:
Some scripts might be misaligned with your game version. Only activate what you need.

VRAM Bypass Not Working:
Ensure the bypass script matches your game version. If all else fails, rage like Kratos and reload!
