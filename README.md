God of War: Ragnarok Cheat Table & VRAM Bypass
This guide provides instructions on how to use the cheat table and enable the VRAM bypass for God of War: Ragnarok. These tools allow you to modify in-game values and bypass VRAM restrictions for smoother gameplay.

Requirements
Cheat Engine

Download and install Cheat Engine.
Cheat Table

Download the cheat table from this repository or a trusted source.
Game Settings

Ensure the game is running in Windowed or Borderless Window mode for easier debugging.
Admin Privileges

Run both Cheat Engine and the game with administrative privileges.
Steps to Use the Cheat Table
Launch the Game

Start God of War: Ragnarok and load your save.
Attach Cheat Engine

Open Cheat Engine.
Click the Process List icon (computer icon in the top-left).
Select the game process (e.g., GOWR.exe) from the list and click Open.
Load the Cheat Table

Click File > Load, then open the downloaded cheat table file (.CT).
Activate Scripts and Cheats

Expand the cheat table entries in Cheat Engine.
Enable desired cheats by checking the corresponding boxes (e.g., Infinite Health, Unlimited Resources).
Enabling VRAM Bypass
The VRAM bypass removes restrictions that prevent the game from running on GPUs with insufficient memory. Follow these steps:

Locate the VRAM Bypass Script

In the cheat table, find the entry labeled VRAM Bypass or similar.
Activate the Script

Check the box next to VRAM Bypass. This modifies the game’s memory to override VRAM checks.
Verify Changes

Restart the game if required and ensure that VRAM-related issues are resolved.
Troubleshooting
Cheat Engine Fails to Attach:
Ensure you’re running both Cheat Engine and the game with administrative privileges.

Game Crashes:

VRAM Bypass Not Working:
Confirm that the script is properly enabled and matches your game version.
